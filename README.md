# Dropbeat

This repo is made to just test my js skills and ui skills nothing too fancy like a navidrome or subsonic client.

Drag and Drop Music Player to just play single songs for now.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
